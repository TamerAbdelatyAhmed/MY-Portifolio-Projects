Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that require capital, time and skills.
Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring.
Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate.
An average company loses anywhere between 1% and 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed.
Hiring a new employee costs an average of $7645 (0-500 corporation).
It takes 52 days on average to fill a position.
I work as a data scientist at a multinational corporation. 
The HR team collected extensive data on their employees and approached you to develop a model that could predict which employees are more likely to quit. 
The team provided you with an extensive data, here's a sample of the dataset: 
JobInvolvement
Education
JobSatisfaction
PerformanceRating
RelationshipSatisfaction
WorkLifeBalance
